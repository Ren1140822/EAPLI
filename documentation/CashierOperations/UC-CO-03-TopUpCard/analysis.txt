CLASSES ANALYSIS
-----------------

We chose to make the Transaction an aggregate root referring an AccountCard because the AccountCard
can have many transactions (take as an example a person that lunches everyday on a cafeteria).
If the Transaction would be contained on the Account Card, it would be a big overhead for the application.
That way, making the Transaction a separately aggregate, to show the account card balance we donâ€™t
need to load all the associated transactions.

-----------------
BUSINESS RULES
-----------------

A transaction has a date and an amount in Euros.
An account card has a list of transactions and a Balance.
A balance has the current amount (result from the sum of the transactions).
